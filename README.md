# MIT18.06SC-Linear-Algebra
This is an excellent course in linear algebra. The course consists of three units:   
* unit I: ax = b and the four subspaces  
* unit II: least squares, determinants and eigenvalues  
* unit III: positive definite matrices and applications determinants and eigenvalues


I took the first two units of the course and have completed all the assignments post online.
